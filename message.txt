On November   died the Princess Charlotte only child of the
Prince Regent and heir to the crown of England Her short life had
hardly been a happy one By nature impulsive capricious and vehement
she had always longed for liberty and she had never possessed it
She had been brought up among violent family quarrels had been early
separated from her disreputable and eccentric mother and handed over to
the care of her disreputable and selfish father When she was seventeen
he decided to marry her off to the Prince of Orange she at first
acquiesced but suddenly falling in love with Prince Augustus of
Prussia she determined to break off the engagement This was not her
first love affair for she had previously carried on a clandestine
correspondence with a Captain Hess Prince Augustus was already married
morganatically but she did not know it and he did not tell her While
she was spinning out the negotiations with the Prince of Orange the
allied sovereignit was June arrived in London to celebrate
their victory Among them in the suite of the Emperor of Russia was
the young and handsome Prince Leopold of SaxeCoburg He made several
attempts to attract the notice of the Princess but she with her heart
elsewhere paid very little attention Next month the Prince Regent
discovering that his daughter was having secret meetings with Prince
Augustus suddenly appeared upon the scene and after dismissing her
household sentenced her to a strict seclusion in Windsor Park God
Almighty grant me patience she exclaimed falling on her knees in an
agony of agitation then she jumped up ran down the backstairs and out
into the street hailed a passing cab and drove to her mothers house
in Bayswater She was discovered pursued and at length yielding
to the persuasions of her uncles the Dukes of York and Sussex of
Brougham and of the Bishop of Salisbury she returned to Carlton House
at two oclock in the morning She was immured at Windsor but no more
was heard of the Prince of Orange Prince Augustus too disappeared
The way was at last open to Prince Leopold of SaxeCoburg

This Prince was clever enough to get round the Regent to impress the
Ministers and to make friends with another of the Princesss uncles
the Duke of Kent Through the Duke he was able to communicate privately
with the Princess who now declared that he was necessary to
her happiness When after Waterloo he was in Paris the Dukes
aidedecamp carried letters backwards and forwards across the Channel
In January  he was invited to England and in May the marriage took
place

The character of Prince Leopold contrasted strangely with that of
his wife The younger son of a German princeling he was at this time
twentysix years of age he had served with distinction in the war
against Napoleon he had shown considerable diplomatic skill at the
Congress of Vienna and he was now to try his hand at the task of taming
a tumultuous Princess Cold and formal in manner collected in speech
careful in action he soon dominated the wild impetuous generous
creature by his side There was much in her he found of which he could
not approve She quizzed she stamped she roared with laughter she
had very little of that selfcommand which is especially required of
princes her manners were abominable Of the latter he was a good judge
having moved as he himself explained to his niece many years later in
the best society of Europe being in fact what is called in French de
la fleur des pois There was continual friction but every scene
ended in the same way Standing before him like a rebellious boy in
petticoats her body pushed forward her hands behind her back with
flaming cheeks and sparkling eyes she would declare at last that she
was ready to do whatever he wanted If you wish it I will do it she
would say I want nothing for myself he invariably answered When
I press something on you it is from a conviction that it is for your
interest and for your good

Among the members of the household at Claremont near Esher where the
royal pair were established was a young German physician Christian
Friedrich Stockmar He was the son of a minor magistrate in Coburg and
after taking part as a medical officer in the war he had settled down
as a doctor in his native town Here he had met Prince Leopold who had
been struck by his ability and on his marriage brought him to England
as his personal physician A curious fate awaited this young man
many were the gifts which the future held in store for himmany and
variousinfluence power mystery unhappiness a broken heart At
Claremont his position was a very humble one but the Princess took
a fancy to him called him Stocky and romped with him along the
corridors Dyspeptic by constitution melancholic by temperament he
could yet be lively on occasion and was known as a wit in Coburg He
was virtuous too and served the royal menage with approbation My
master he wrote in his diary is the best of all husbands in all the
five quarters of the globe and his wife bears him an amount of love
the greatness of which can only be compared with the English national
debt Before long he gave proof of another qualitya quality which was
to colour the whole of his lifecautious sagacity When in the spring
of  it was known that the Princess was expecting a child the post
of one of her physiciansinordinary was offered to him and he had
the good sense to refuse it He perceived that his colleagues would be
jealous of him that his advice would probably not be taken but that
if anything were to go wrong it would be certainly the foreign doctor
who would be blamed Very soon indeed he came to the opinion that the
low diet and constant bleedings to which the unfortunate Princess was
subjected were an error he drew the Prince aside and begged him to
communicate this opinion to the English doctors but it was useless The
fashionable lowering treatment was continued for months On November 
at nine oclock in the evening after a labour of over fifty hours the
Princess was delivered of a dead boy At midnight her exhausted strength
gave way When at last Stockmar consented to see her he went in and
found her obviously dying while the doctors were plying her with wine
She seized his hand and pressed it They have made me tipsy she said
After a little he left her and was already in the next room when he
heard her call out in her loud voice Stocky Stocky As he ran back
the deathrattle was in her throat She tossed herself violently from
side to side then suddenly drew up her legs and it was over

The Prince after hours of watching had left the room for a few
moments rest and Stockmar had now to tell him that his wife was dead
At first he could not be made to realise what had happened On their way
to her room he sank down on a chair while Stockmar knelt beside him it
was all a dream it was impossible At last by the bed he too knelt
down and kissed the cold hands Then rising and exclaiming Now I am
quite desolate Promise me never to leave me he threw himself into
Stockmars arms
